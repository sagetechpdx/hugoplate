My professional journey began in 2013 when I was hired to manage the IT needs for a 70-person software development company. For the next decade I honed my skills as a systems administrator and acquired industry certifications while living in Michigan.

In 2022 I visited Portland for the first time and fell in love with the city and the natural splendor of the Pacific Northwest.
